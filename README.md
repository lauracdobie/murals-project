# Glasgow Murals

JavaScript group project with Katie Strong and Cameron Maclean for the CodeClan Professional Software Development course. A full stack app which aims to provide local residents, tourists, art students and tourism professionals with information on murals in Glasgow and promote a positive image of the city. We created a database of murals based on the Glasgow mural trail website, which are presented in a list and a Leaflet map in the front end. Users can filter the murals by title, artist name, year, location and description and the list and map will update instantly. Users can also like or unlike a mural.

Built using React, Leaflet, Express.js and MongoDB.
